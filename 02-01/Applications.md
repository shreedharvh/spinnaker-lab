Spinnaker application configuration is done principally through the UI

As a part of the setup of this project, on github, fork the  https://github.com/robertstarmer/hostname.git app as we'll use this as the basis for our explorations

Select the Application tab from the top (dark) menu bar
select the actions menu on the left in the second menu bar (lighter)
Select create application

Name: hostname
Owner: your@github.email.address
RepoType: github
RepoProject: your "project" or organization name (usually your github username) e.g. robertstarmer
RepoName: The repository name (hostname in this example and if you kept the name in forking)

leave the rest unchanged, and "create" your app.
